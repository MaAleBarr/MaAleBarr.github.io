As long as I can remember I've wanted to be an astronaut. This desire solidified in my formative years through a visit by an astronaut candidate to my school, an epic trip to Cape Canaveral, and a gift from my brother-- a copy of a Brief History of Time, Spanish edition. My room was covered with space paraphernalia, I read about space, astronomy, and astrobiology. I learned all I could about NASA and JPL. I spent many hours staring at the stars imagining what it would be like to be out there, suited up, floating in free space. However there was a *minor* hitch to my grand ambition: I was born and raised in Colombia-- aka no space program, aka no astronauts. :/

Astronaut dreams crushed, I decided to go to the U.S. and study aerospace engineering. In the process of doing that I realized how much I enjoyed physics and pursued that instead. I got a chance to do research on asteroids and variables stars during my undergraduate years, and fell in love with a beautifully large, baby blue, laser system during a summer intership. I mean, who doesn't like lasers?
This set the course for received a Ph.D. in plasma physics, performing research in High-Energy Density Physics, Shock physics, and fusion sciences. I took a postdoc position at LLNL and stayed on as a staff scientist for several years. Motivated to have a larger impact on current problems that need solutions now, I made a transition into data science. I am currently a senior data scientist working at an applied research lab, where we focus on deep learning solutions for a wide range of applications.
