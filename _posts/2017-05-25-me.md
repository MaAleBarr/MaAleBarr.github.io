description: A little more about my story
---

I’ve always had a passion for numbers, equations, and challenging things. I can vividly remember the first time I saw a real math book; you know, the one’s where you no longer write your answers in. It was my older cousin’s calculus book. It was beautiful, it was organized, it was massive, it had so many equations! It had breadth. I was about seven years old and at that point was anxious for the day I would have one of my own. So yes, the science fair was one of my favorite times of the year, and yes, I participated in math olympics.

I left Colombia for my undergrad and came to the U.S. thinking I would become an aerospace engineer. However, the twists and turns in life led me to become passionate about physics and philosophy, receiving degrees in both. During a summer internship after my junior year of college, I got the chance to visit the [Laboratory for Laser Energetics](http://www.lle.rochester.edu/) (LLE). At the time I was working at SUNY Geneseo, where we were developing a rapid pneumatic system for radioactive samples. The need for this type of system was motivated by large laser facilities like the Omega laser at LLE, where laser-driven fusion is their bread and butter. As part of the internship the group was invited to go see the Omega laser, getting a VIP tour from one of the LLE staff. He took us to the viewing gallery, right between the amplifier bay and the target bay; a perfect vantage point to appreciate the enormity of the football field size system. A vast room with amplifiers to the right, a 3-meter diameter target chamber to the left. It was absolutely beautiful. I couldn’t take my eyes off all the bolts, the pointing mirrors, the ports in the target chamber with attached diagnostics, the smaller laser off to the side that was Omega’s heart beat, synchronizing all the diagnostics to collect data at a precise time. 60 laser beams entering a target chamber, capable of delivering 30 kJ of energy onto a mm-scale target, in a billionth of a second. I was sold. I knew exactly where I wanted to be in a years time.

I received a PhD in plasma physics from the University of Rochester, the academic institution the LLE is part of. During my time at LLE I was one of the few graduate students who did work in the target bay aligning and setting the diagnostics my research group worked with (bunny suit and all — the target bay and laser bay are clean rooms), collaborated with scientist from national labs coming to LLE to do experiments, and was granted time on the laser to do my own experiments. I travelled all over the U.S. to present results at conferences, and was nominated for an invited talk before graduating. It was an amazing experience.

The Omega laser was the most powerful UV laser in the world before the construction of the [National Ignition Facility](https://lasers.llnl.gov/) (NIF). NIF is a $3.5 billion facility housed at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/) (LLNL), that took several years to built. [First light as a full system was in 2009](https://www.wired.com/2009/05/energy-of-the-future-igniting-a-star-with/), and the entire community was beyond excited to use it. NIF is a 192 beam laser system, capable of delivering 1.8 MJ (that is 1800 kJ !) onto a mm-scale target, also in a billionth of a second. It gave us, for the first time, a fighting chance to achieve ignition: pushing a fusion experiment to conditions where the energy released from the reaction is larger than the amount of laser energy delivered to the target — a net gain in energy. When I finished my PhD in 2010, I wanted to be in the thick of it. I was offered a postdoctoral position at LLNL to work on experiments at NIF, and didn’t hesitate to take it. Two years later I was offered a staff scientist position.

At NIF I dove into the x-ray world. I contributed to the design and fielding of a photoconductive diamond detector and various X-ray spectrometers. I worked on developing X-ray sources for various applications and used X-ray spectroscopy to diagnose different aspects of fusion experiments at NIF. I am first author and contributing author to many publications from NIF experiments, and traveled extensively to present results at conferences. I must confess it was bitter-sweet to leave NIF and my colleagues, some with whom I’d worked for ~10 years. But much like that beautiful baby blue laser that lured me into plasma physics, more and more I felt the need to explore data science. It wasn’t physical nuts and bolts this time, but conceptual nuts and bolts of extremely powerful algorithms we now have the computing power to use. The large amount of data we now generate daily, and the implication of what can be done if the two are combined.

I am also not a robot and enjoy a lot of other things apart from algorithms, equations, and numbers. When I am not exercising my brain I am baking or cooking, or enjoying the outdoors (running, biking, hiking) to counterbalance my sweet tooth. I love dancing (I cannot deny my roots), practice yoga, have a liking for traveling, and enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I’m also a big soccer fan.
