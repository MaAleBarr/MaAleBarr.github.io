I had the fortune to visit India last September. I was there for a conference, [Interpseech 2018](https://interspeech2018.org/), a premier conference focusing on speech research and technology. I took the opportunity to spend some extra time and explore India, for the first time.

India is a beautiful country. Amazing monuments, forts, paintings. A country full of undeniable culture.

All your senses are electrified, shocked, running on over-drive, day one. Colorful clothes, unknown smells, prayers dancing in the air in languages you don't understand. Vibrant strangers asking to take pictures with you. The incessant melody of beeping cars, their drivers seemingly using the horns for echolocation. It is Brownian motion at its best.

But all this splendid chaos seems muted compared to the food. The unexpected flavors, their intensity, and the blend of spices. Nothing is dull. Nothing is bland. Everything made my scalp sweat from the heat. A strange feeling, and a first for me. This was my taste of India. Painful as it was at times, I would eat it all again in a heart beat.

I did adhere to my Dr.'s recommendation to stay away from fresh produce and eat cooked, if not boiled, food only. I had never craved fresh tomatoes to such high degree.
