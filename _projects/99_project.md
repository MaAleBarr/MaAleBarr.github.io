I absolutely enjoy baking cakes. Not only because they are sweet and delicious and you get to share them with your friends, but also because they can be small architecture projects.

When I start a cake I usually have a mental picture of what I want to make and how I want to decorate it. The end product is, most of the times, some odd transform of my original vision. This time around I wanted to document this process.

 Holiday season 2018: I wanted something festive, with a bit of humor. I decided make a snowman cake... a melting snowman cake #GlobalWarming. This is the original sketch. I wanted the snowman to look a bit distressed and frantic. Maybe a little scared? I mean, he/she *is* melting. Flavor palette: burnt butter/vanilla cake with maple syrup mascarpone filling.

This was also a bit of an experiment, as it was the first time I was attempting to bake a spherical cake. Lessons learned: spherical cakes cook a little faster. Also don't be stingy with the batter-- I was and the lower half of my cake was a bit smaller than I intended. Not surprisingly, covering a sphere with fondant is a bit more challenging, but I had geometry on my side. Not perfect, but I got the job done. From left to right: spherical cake with fondant and bottom with crumb layer, top and bottom with fondant, and finished cake.

Two more views of the cake. I made earmuffs (with flowers) and a scarf for the snowman using fondant. I wanted the scarf to look old, so added details to make it look used and ragged.
